# Hometown-Highlights
A web mashup of Facebook &amp; Flickr

Hey there! Ever wondered what cool photos people are snapping in your hometown? I combined the powers of Facebook and Flickr to show you the best shots from where you grew up. Check it out!

What's It Do?:
So, 'Hometown Highlights' peeks at your Facebook profile (with your permission, of course!) to see where you're from. Then, it dives into Flickr to find some of the top photos from that place. It's like a quick trip down memory lane.

APIs I Played With:

Facebook: Figured out where you called "home".

Flickr: Hunted for those awesome pics of your hometown.

Log In Stuff: I've hooked it up with Facebook's oAuth, so you can quickly jump in. It's all secure and just makes things smoother.

Cool Bits:

Your Hometown in HD: See your roots through some stellar photos.
React Over Handlebars: Used React's JSX to get everything looking nice and dynamic.
Quick Data Pulls: Used Promise.all() with fetch to grab data super quick from both APIs.

This was a fun uni project, blending personal info with awesome imagery. Take a look at the code, or just enjoy the pics!
